# react-component-lib

This is a boilerplate repository for creating npm packages with React components written in TypeScript and using styled-components.

## Installation:

To install all dependencies run `npm install`.

## Developing your library:

To start developing your library, run `npm run dev`. It will run your library using storybook where you can test your components. Each time you make changes to your library, storybook will be reloaded to reflect your changes.

## Typescript

This boilerplate lets you develop your libraries in Typescript and you can simultaneously test it in Typescript storybook.
